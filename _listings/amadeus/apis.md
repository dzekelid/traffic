  description: "The Flight Traffic API lets you find the origin and destination traffic
    summary between two journey points over a specified period.\nThe search returns
    number of flights & travelers for each origin and destination, ordered by popularity,
    for each month specified within the search period. This search can help you answer
    questions like \"Where are people from Los Angeles traveling to between January
    and April of 2015?\" or \"Which is the most popular month for New Yorkers to travel
    last year?\". \nThis search is based on Amadeus' Travel Intelligence Engine, a
    high performance scalable cloud-based platform, born in the age of Big Data and
    purposely built for the industry bringing total flexibility and speed to business
    intelligence for travel. Please see amadeus.com/travelintelligence for more information."
