    have a lot of trafficpolicy instances, you can use the MaxItems parameter to list
    them in groups of upto 100.The response includes five values that help you navigate
    from one group ofMaxItems traffic policy instances to the next:             IsTruncated           If
    the value of IsTruncated in the response is true,there are more traffic policy
    instances associated with the current AWSaccount.If IsTruncated is false, this
    response includes the lasttraffic policy instance that is associated with the
    current account.             MaxItems           The value that you specified for
    the MaxItems parameter in the requestthat produced the current response.                  HostedZoneIdMarker,
    TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker, and TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker               If
